- StepperDemo: ramp state is written as plain text

0.7.1:
- StepperDemo extended with commands to 
		return status code from move/moveTo
		toggle motor info (I) to suppress info while steppers are running
		output usage (?)
		output motor info with usage
		test direct drive of stepper by port manipulation bypassing the library (T)
- move/moveTo return error codes

0.7.0: Changes towards 0.6.15
- Fix possible floating point exception (divide by zero), which could happen rarely in isr_single_fill_queue
- Remove deprecated functions:
	addQueueStepperStop()
    isStopped()
- internal: remove obsolete _stepper_num variable
