pre 0.9.0:
- implement forceStopAndNewPosition()
- StepperDemo extended to cause forceStopAndNewPosition by press X
- addQueueEntry() returns now an int8_t instead of an int

0.8.3:
- AVR: timer compare interrupts are only enabled, if stepper is running.
- AVR: on arrival of a command, the queue is started with few µs delay
- Implement backwardStep() and forwardStep()
- Bug solved: Speed changes at very low speed with high acceleration values are not always performed
  Actually speed with period times > 268436µs has not worked at all before.

0.8.2:
- Solved issue: Queue is filled too much, which cause slow response to speed/acceleration changes
  => Queue is filled to max ~10ms into the future.

0.8.1:
- Fix issue #8: Long step times are less accurate than short ones
  => All time delta between steps are cycle accurate
- Add getPeriodAfterCommandsCompleted() to API
- Fix bug due to AutoEnable at ramp start (can find at low speeds)
- StepperDemo outputs: F_CPU/TICKS_PER_S and stepper period at queue end

0.8.0:
- Change direction with running motor is possible !!!
- stopMove() can be called from interrupt routine
- Refactor ramp generation code into RampGenerator.h/cpp
- StepperDemo: ramp state is written as plain text
- Mention platformio in README

0.7.1:
- StepperDemo extended with commands to 
		return status code from move/moveTo
		toggle motor info (I) to suppress info while steppers are running
		output usage (?)
		output motor info with usage
		test direct drive of stepper by port manipulation bypassing the library (T)
- move/moveTo return error codes

0.7.0: Changes towards 0.6.15
- Fix possible floating point exception (divide by zero), which could happen rarely in isr_single_fill_queue
- Remove deprecated functions:
	addQueueStepperStop()
    isStopped()
- internal: remove obsolete _stepper_num variable
