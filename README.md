# FastAccelStepper

This is an high speed alternative for the [AccelStepper library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/). It makes use of the 16 bit Timer 1 ot the Atmega 328 and as such supports one or two stepper motors.

The stepper motors should be connected via a driver IC (like 4988) with a 1, 2 or 3-wire connection:
* Step Signal
	- This must be connected for stepper A to Pin 9 and for Stepper B to Pin 10.
	- Step should be done on transition Low to High. High time will be only a few us.
* Direction Signal (optional)
	- This can be any port pin.
* Enable Signal (optional)
	- This can be any port pin.

FastAccelStepper offers the following features:
* 1-pin operation e.g. peristaltic pump
* 2-pin operation e.g. axis control
* 3-pin operation for power reduction
* supports up to two stepper motors using DIR/STEP/Enable Control (Direction and Enable is optional)
* allows up to roughly 32000 generated steps per second in dual stepper operation
* fully interrupt driven - no periodic task to be called
* supports acceleration and deceleration with per stepper max speed/acceleration
* speed/acceleration can be varied while stepper is running
* Auto enable mode: stepper motor is enabled before movement and disabled afterwards

The library is used with A4988, but other driver ICs could work, too.

## Usage

```
#include "FastAccelStepper.h"

#define dirPinStepperA    5
#define enablePinStepperA 6
#define stepPinStepperA   9  /* OC1A, just for information here */

FastAccelStepperEngine fas_engine = FastAccelStepperEngine();
FastAccelStepper stepperA = fas_engine.stepperA();
//FastAccelStepper stepperB = fas_engine.stepperB();

void setup() {
   fas_engine.init();
   stepperA->setDirectionPin(dirPinStepperA);
   stepperA->setEnablePin(enablePinStepperA);

   stepperA->set_auto_enable(true);

   stepperA->set_dynamics(100.0, 10.0);
   stepperA->move(1000);
}

void loop() {
}
```


## Behind the curtains

The timer 1 is used with prescaler 1. With the arduino nano running at 16 MHz, timer overflow interrupts are generated every ~4 ms. This interrupt is used for adjusting the acceleration. 

The timer compare unit toggles the step pin from Low to High very precisely. The transition High to Low is done in the interrupt routine, thus the High state is only few us.

After stepper movement is completed, the timer compare unit is disconnected from the step pin. Thus the application could change the state freely, while the stepper is not controlled by this library.

The compare interrupt routines uses two staged tick counters. One byte (msb) + one word (lsw). The max tick counter value is msb * 16384 + lsw, msb 0..255, lsw 0..32767 => 4,410,687. At 16 MHz this comes down to 0.26s. Thus the speed is limited down to approx 3.8 steps/s.

## TODO

1. Change from speed [steps/s] into time delta [Âµs/steps]
2. Avoid float after use of time delta
3. Introduce command queue of speed/accel commands - one per stepper. This will allow exact speed control.
4. Change in direction requires motor stop !
5. Using constant acceleration leads to force jumps at start and max speed => smooth this out
